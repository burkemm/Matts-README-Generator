**What's the result of my work for this webpage?** <BR />
This website is my professional portfolio for future employers.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned a lot about the display flex option. I tinkered a lot with margins. I perfected posting hyperlinks that open in a new window. I learned to also have a lot of tenacity with web developing. It's easy to get stuck, but I don't get discouraged.
